# Remote Controlled Lights
**Arduino Remote Controlled LEDs**\
*Created By James Rupa*

## Project Description

This is my first Arduino project that was made entirely from scratch and only did a bit of research to see how it works. Basically, this program and schematic shown below are used to control a series of LEDs from a remote controlled. This was a little side project I made to present on STEM night for the AP Computer Science A class.

## How To Use The Project

1. Download the Arduino IDE
2. Download the file using terminal or direct download
3. Install the library used to create the project link below:\
